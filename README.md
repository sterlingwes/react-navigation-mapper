# react-navigation-mapper

So far, an experiment.

## Todos

- [ ] keep user components so we can render the whole tree
- [ ] keep all conditionals that lead to rendered components
- [ ] hoist / statically link all conditionals so they can be enumerated
- [ ] figure out how to deal with things like `useUserAuthenticated` that wrap a condition used to render screen paths
